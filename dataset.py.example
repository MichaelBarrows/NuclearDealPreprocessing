# File containing dataset paths, and output paths.
# To get started:
#   add the path to your datasets in to the "datasets" variable
#   add the path for your output data to the "output_data" variable
#   add the relative path (relative to "dataset" variable) for each of the files.
#     example:
#       dataset = "/home/user/iran_datasets"

# Path to datasets output from nuclear deal tweet extraction
dataset = ""

# Path to output data storage folder
output_data = ""

# the generic and specific files output from nuclear deal tweet extraction step
generic = "generic.csv"
specific = "specific.csv"

all_datasets = [generic, specific]
